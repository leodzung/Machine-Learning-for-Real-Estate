## Outlook for 2020

It might be a good time to start thinking about investing in real estate as Zillow experts predicted that recession will start in 2020. The money policies compounded with the COVID-19 pandemic will likely result in the prediction becoming reality.

## Data source

### Zillow Housing Data

Zillow housing data can be found here:
https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

We are particularly interested in the following datasets:
1. Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for Single Family Homes. This data setc can be downloaded here: http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public_v2/zhvi/Zip_Zhvi_SingleFamilyResidence.csv

ZHVI is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. In this project I chose to investigate the home value in a certain ZIP code.

There are other datasets that are quite interesting for further exploration but will not be utilized in this projects: ZHVI for all type of home, including condo/co-op, rental data set, and actual inventory and sales.
